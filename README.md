# Output-Console-Snake
Snake game running in the IDE terminal, or in output console (on windows). Simple game, using symbols, letters, number in printf() function to visualize the game.

Starting the game:
1. Press on running program
2. If there are no errors, you see text in the output console. One is saying press upper key to start, and under that the other saying quit game by pressing down key.
3. After pressing the upper key, the program will ask that how big should the field be. at first it is easier to just press 0<space>0 (so basically: 0 0).
4. Then you will see the field.
5. Your snake is always at the center of the field, when starting the game.
6. Press one of the direction keys and you are good to go.

Game:
1. The snake dies in the walls and there is one blue wall on the field, thats lethal too. Going into yourself is also deadly.
2. You have to move your snake's head through the G letters, which are the fruits, and they give you points.
3. There are 3 different fruits (you can tell the difference by their color). The white one makes your snake bigger (or longer), the green one teleports the snake to a random coordinate on the field, and the purple one doubles the snake's speed (speed can stack up, if you eat more than one purple fruits in a row). Each fruit gives 1 point to your score.
4. To win the game, you need a score of 50.
5. To leave during the game, you have to press backspace twice, and you return to the main menu.
